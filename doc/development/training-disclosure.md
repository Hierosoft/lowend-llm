# Training Disclosure for lowend-llm
This Training Disclosure, which may be more specifically titled above here (and in this document possibly referred to as "this disclosure"), is based on **Training Disclosure version 1.1.4** at https://github.com/Hierosoft/training-disclosure by Jake Gustafson. Jake Gustafson is probably *not* an author of the project unless listed as a project author, nor necessarily the disclosure editor(s) of this copy of the disclosure unless this copy is the original which among other places I, Jake Gustafson, state IANAL. The original disclosure is released under the [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/) license, but regarding any text that differs from the original:

This disclosure also functions as a claim of copyright to the scope described in the paragraph below since potentially in some jurisdictions output not of direct human origin, by certain means of generation at least, may not be copyrightable (again, IANAL):

This disclosure is a voluntary of how and where content in or used by this project was produced by LLM(s) or any tools that are "trained" in any way.

The main section of this disclosure lists such tools. For each, the version, install location, and a scope of their training sources in a way that is specific as possible.

Subsections of this disclosure contain prompts used to generate content, in a way that is complete to the best ability of the disclosure editor(s).

tool(s) used:
- GPT-4-Turbo (Version 4o, chatgpt.com)

Scope of use: code described in subsections--typically modified by hand to improve logic, variable naming, integration, etc.

## app.py, index.html, frontend.py
how make a web interface for ollama using python? Make an api and a simple frontend page using unpoly

assuming the file is called index.html, serve the page using http.server using a frontend.py file that runs on port 8080

place the code in a main function that returns 0 if ok, and if __name__ is __main__ sys.exit(main())

- log in (anonymous chat ran out)

Modify this program to run main from the module called frontend concurrently:

- paste app.py

How do I know what port it is running on, and the api path for the form?

- answer:
  - Flask API (Backend)
    Runs on port 5000
    The API endpoint for the form is POST /generate
    Example API request:
    sh
    curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/generate -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"input": "Hello"}'

Fix the frontend to use the api correctly (clicking the button just displayr "Failed to connect to the server."):

- paste the old index.html

I pasted your code from anonymous chat and the error case isn't very good. I changed the error output line to show the actual error: document.getElementById('error').innerHTML = "Failed to connect to the server.\n" + error; and the error is "TypeError: failed to fetch". Fix the line in your version and also try to use the API and Unpoly correctly to fix the error.

up was not defined, so I tried <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/unpoly@3.10.1/unpoly.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/unpoly@3.10.1/unpoly.min.css"> but now we are still not using unpoly 3 correctly. Clicking the button causes Failed to connect to the server.[object Object]

You keep putting `" + error;` on a separate line and it breaks the program.

use the correct cdn code I showed you: <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/unpoly@3.10.1/unpoly.min.js"></script>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/unpoly@3.10.1/unpoly.min.css">

Failed to connect to the server. TypeError: up.fetch is not a function

Correctly utilize the error when it is an object rather than a string. All we see currently is Failed to connect to the server. [object Object]

Make the backend app.py file accept POST. The console on the server says "127.0.0.1 - - [31/Jan/2025 19:30:31] code 501, message Unsupported method ('POST')". Here is the current version of app.py:

- paste app.py with additions for logging

- Used search.brave.com LLM to convert from the sample curl command on the ollama website to PowerShell and Python.

- Made manual changes to fix scripts to work with the lowend-llm web API.

- back in ChatGPT later:

Convert this bash script to PowerShell:
```
#!/bin/bash
if [ ! -d .venv ]; then
    >&2 echo "Error: You must first setup .venv according to the readme."
    exit 1
fi
./.venv/bin/python local-chat.py
```

pass along all the user's arguments used to call the PowerShell script along to the python script.

Now fix the bash script the same way
